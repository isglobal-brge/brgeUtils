Manual ./imputeinversion.sh

Arguments
  -f,--dataformat
       Indicate if the data to be imputed is in PLINK (.bed/.bim/.fam) or VCF format (should be .gz). Valid inputs:
                                     -f vcf      -f VCF      -f plink      -f PLINK
  -d,--data
       Data to be imputed. The input of this argument should be the name of the files to be analysed (without the extension).
       If the files are: colorectal.bed colorectal.bim colorectal.fam; then this argument should be used as follows: -d colorectal
       If the file is: colorectal.vcf.gz; then this argument should be used as follows: -d colorectal
  
  -i,--inversions
       Indicate the inversion regions for which we want the imputed data (the output of the program will be a VCF file with imputed data of the region(s) indicated in this argument).
       Valid inputs (in hg19):
         - GenomicRange.
               -i 8:8055789-11980649
         - Name of the inversion (use -h to see all the names of available inversions).
               -i inv8p23.1
         - Text file with the regions of interest. 
               -i genomic_regions.txt
           The separators in the text file can be ' ', ':', '-', '\t'. The following examples would be valid:
                                 7:54290974-54386821          7    54290974    54386821          7 54290974 54386821               
                                 8:8055789-11980649           8    8055789    11980649           8 8055789 11980649
                                 17:43661775-44372665         17    43661775    44372665         17 43661775 44372665 
       
         - All / ALL / all. This option will impute all the inversions available at the scoreInvHap package (-h,--help shows the availabe inversions)
               -i All
 
  -t,--threads
        INT (by default set to 1). Number of threads that will be used in SHAPEIT and Minimac3. From SHAPEIT webpage: "If there are 1,000 individuals in the dataset, 
        SHAPEIT using 4 threads will phase 4 individuals simultaneously conditional upon the 1000 - 4 = 996 others individuals. It allows to divide the running time of 
        SHAPEIT by almost 4 in this case, so 4 hours becomes 1! This option is recommended only if you have a large number of individuals in your dataset. Note that using 
        a number of threads bigger than the number of available cores will not further decrease the running times."
